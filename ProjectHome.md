## About ##
Strong password will generate passwords like “elmZ6DoLzCIMq6Vk6WfC3Uh8Qc6ZL5E” using a simple keyword like “test”!

Unlike other passwords program strong password does not store any password on file. The program uses a strong hash-algorithm called BCrypt which is practicable impossible to brute force, making the password secure against hackers.

The passwords is generated using a master keyword and a keyword.


**Master Keyword (unique per user)**

Should be something long and personally.

For reinstall purpose, you either need to remember the master password value or make backup of the file.


**Keyword (unique per site)**

Should be unique but does not need to be strong, like the site or account name.
Does not need to be complex as the master keyword makes it complex.

As some sites limits the length of the password, you can make customs profiles that limits the strong passwords length.

## Files ##
The program stores two files on the local machine for settings.
The location is in the user directory making it possible for multiple users on the same machine.

All custome profiles
```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\StrongPassword\Profile.xml
